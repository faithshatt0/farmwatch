HerScript Hacks '17 - allows farmers and workers to come together on one website and communicate effectively 


*DISCLAIMER*: ORIGINAL PROJECT CREATION WAS NOT ORGANIZED THROUGH GITHUB

Agriculture is a huge part of Salinas in many ways and actually provides many jobs for a large immigrant population.
Many of these immigrants don’t have many opportunities when they first come to California. 
So, working in the fields is often one of the few options they have to make a living from. 

Furthermore, one major issue that arises between the employers (Farmers) and these field workers is communication. There are multiple 
factors that contribute to this issue. For instance, there’s often a language barrier because many of these immigrants only speak Spanish.
So, in order to communicate safety precautions and regulations, scheduling opportunities, and location resources, we wanted to make a
site that would encompass a few of these sources together to make a place for both farmers and field workers to communicate better. 
For the finished product, we would of liked to make the site available in other languages as well. 

The site consists of a Farmer’s portal and a Worker’s portal as well as mutual accommodationslike the regulations, safety, 
and companies involved.

On the farmer’s side, there would be a scheduling page where they can fill out the days they need to do certain tasks to a 
field and provide which field would need that work being done. There would also be a request page where the manager of those 
fields could confirm a certain number of people who would like to work on the field on certain days. 

On the worker’s side, there would also be a scheduling page that they could view and select the days they would like to show up.
The workers would then receive an “okay” from the manager to show up that day to work. 

We wanted this process to be within a site because not everyone has a phone or a consistent phone number to make communication easy
between the workers and their employers. Also, there are publicly accessible computers at libraries and colleges that can make it easier
for workers to get these field jobs and check their confirmation.

Our site is far from complete and is mostly a conceptual piece in its current state. We would like to add the functionality to the 
conceptual pages if we were to publish the site. However, we have yet to bring together a large enough team to do this and we are still
taking classes on how to make the kinds of programs we would like to see in this kind of site.
